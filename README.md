# BlackJack
Project Overview

This project is a console-based BlackJack game written in C++. The program simulates a simplified version of classic casino BlackJack where the player competes against the dealer. It handles all core elements of gameplay: creating and shuffling a deck, dealing cards, calculating hand values (including Ace logic for 1 or 11), processing player choices (“hit” or “stand”), executing dealer rules, and determining the final winner.

The game runs entirely in the console and focuses on clean logic and object-oriented structure rather than graphics. It serves as a foundational Java project that demonstrates card-game logic, class design, and program flow control.
